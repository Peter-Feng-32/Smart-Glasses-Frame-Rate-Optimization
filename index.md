## Introduction

This is a project to optimize the Tooz Smart Glasses into a product usable as a Terminal display for running different Command Line Programs.

### Background

The tooz Smart Glasses are a pair of smart glasses made by tooz technologies, which is a joint venture by Deutsche Telekom and ZEISS developing smart optics.  More information about them can be found at https://tooz.com/.

The tooz glasses offer many advantages, not least of which is their form factor.  They are relatively lightweight and slim, and therefore can actually be comfortably worn for daily use.  However, the main drawback of the glasses is the display is very slow.  Tooz provides a way to send 400x640 frames to the glasses through their API, but they recommend not sending more than 1 frame per second, or the glasses will fail to display the frames correctly.
